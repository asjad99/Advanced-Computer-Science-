- See [What is Computer Science?](https://github.com/asjad99/algorithms-GYM/tree/master)


#### Data Structures 

- A data structure (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.
- An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to. The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.
