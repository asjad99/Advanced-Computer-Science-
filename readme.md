## About

Computer science as an academic discipline began in the 1960's. Emphasis was on programming languages, compilers, operating systems, and the mathematical theory that supported these areas. Courses in theoretical computer science covered finite automata, regular expressions, context-free languages, and computability. In the 1970â€™s, the study of algorithms was added as an important component of theory. The emphasis was on making computers useful. 

Today, a fundamental change is taking place and the focus is more on a wealth of applications. There are many reasons for this change. The merging of computing and communications has played an important role. The enhanced ability to observe, collect, and store data in the natural sciences, in commerce, and in other fields calls for a change in our understanding of data and how to handle it in the modern setting. The emergence of the web and social networks as central aspects of daily life presents both opportunities and challenges for theory. While traditional areas of computer science remain highly important, increasingly researchers of the future will be involved with using computers to understand and extract usable information from massive data arising in applications, not just how to make computers useful on specific well-defined problems. With this in mind we build a repotoire of techniques to cover the theory we expect to be useful in the next 40 years, just as an understanding of automata theory, algorithms, and related topics gave students an advantage in the last 40 years. One of the major changes is an increase in emphasis on probability, statistics, and numerical methods.

This repo is about exploring timeless ideas and concpets that have stood the test of time. We explore interesting and relatively simple ideas  that constitute the core for building data products. These are in some sense non-obvious,
even to the well-trained computer scientist(i.e they are not found in traditional CS textbooks). It useful to learn mathematically rigorous definitions to some the central problems, ideas and algorithms for building data products
 
Later on (on separate pages) we may add details for understanding the high-level theoretical intuitions and principles underlying the algorithms we discuss, as well as developing a concrete understanding of when and how to implement and apply the algorithms.
