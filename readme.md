   "[The Euclidean algorithm] is the granddaddy of all algorithms, because it is the oldest nontrivial algorithm that has survived to the present day." - Donald Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming


## Useful Data Algorithms for Building Data Products 

A data product provides actionable information without exposing decision makers to the underlying
data or analytics. Examples include: Movie Recommendations, Production Process Improvements, Targeted Advertising etc. For more details see [Rise of data Products](https://asjadkhan.ghost.io/ghost/#/site)
